###  Benefits of Infra As Code

1. Team collaboration

2. Disaster recovery: re-run configurations and create your infrastructure all over again

3. History of changes: when you've got things defined in code, you can see who changed what, when they changed it, what changed they made, why they made those changes and all of that information is stored inside your source control

### The opposite of INfra As Code

Manual Configuration 

For example, when you study and practice or just play around a certain service by clicking through the interface, this sort of process can be quite useful. But what you find over time it makes sense to then transfer that into infrastructure as code. 

It is a whole different process applying the actual code around that rather than just clicking around in the interface.
